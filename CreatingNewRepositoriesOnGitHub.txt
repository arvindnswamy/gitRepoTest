I used the following instructions to create and add some files from a folder to a GitHub repo.
In the folder which contained the files I wanted to add to the repo,
1. touch README.md
2. git init
3. git add README.md Intro*.ipynb cned_anndata.csv wunderground_2020-05-25_2021-05-25.csv combined_cned_wunderground_data.csv conedDataWithEnvData_*.csv
4. git add catConEdSpreadSheet*.png (because I forgot to add these in the previous add)
5. git commit -m "first commit"
6. git remote add origin git@github.com:arvindnswamy/IntroToPythonForMEstudents.git
7. git push -u origin master

This is where I got into trouble. This is what I got
The authenticity of host 'github.com (140.82.114.4)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'github.com,140.82.114.4' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists. CONFIRMED LATER THAT GITHUB REPO NEEDS TO EXIST BEFORE YOU CAN POPULATE IT. I DONT KNOW IF YOU CAN CREATE A GITHUB REPO DIRECTLY FROM COMMAND LINE

It appears that i have to enable ssh keys on my side and include it in the GitHub account.


How did I enable ssh key

1. ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "an2288@columbia.edu"
	Enter file in which to save the key (/home/arvindn/.ssh/id_ed25519): I pressed enter to accept default location
	Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): I entered a passphrase with a similar kind of difficulty as my passwords
	Your public key has been saved in /home/arvindn/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub.
	The key fingerprint is:
	SHA256:vnlskm;;gmk;wmm;gm;gmmm;mvm
	The key's randomart image is:
	+--[ED25519 256]--+

Here is some information about the passphrase: https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/passphrase

Follow the instructions in https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account
to add the SSH key you have generated to your account

Once I did that, I created an empty repository titled IntroToPythonForMEstudents. I am not sure if this was necessary. Then I used the following commands
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/arvindnswamy/IntroToPythonForMEstudents.git
git push -u origin main

The repository was created!

To push further changes:
git commit -am "updated readme" (after I updated the README)
git push -u origin main
